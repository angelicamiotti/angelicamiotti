### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am AngÃ©lica, I have an academic background in maths and physics, and I am currently looking for a job in France or remotely as a Data Analyst or Data Scientist. Recently, I completed Data Analyst training, gaining practical experience with different tools that are currently used such as SQL Server, MySQL, Power BI, and Talend.

In this profile, you will find a project on Business Intelligence that I developed from beginning to end during my data analyst training, as well as another repository showcasing the application of ML techniques.

I'm passionate about continual learning and skill improvement. That is why I am currently learning ML algorithms through a course ML with Sklearn, and I am applying this learning to other datasets that I think are interesting to work on. I'm also diving into ETL tools like Talend, that I acquired some familiarity with previously during my Data Analyst training to master them further.


**How to reach me:** Feel free to email me in English, French, or Portuguese, as you wish, or contact me through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ang%C3%A9lica-de-salvo-miotti-730733197/) account. I would be happy to talk to you. ðŸ˜Š
